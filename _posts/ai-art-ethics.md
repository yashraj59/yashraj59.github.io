Recently, there's been intense debate around AI-generated art, particularly concerning works inspired by beloved styles such as Studio Ghibli's. Passionate opinions are expected, but the ethical outrage often misses the fundamental purpose of artificial intelligence: making creativity accessible.

At its heart, AI aims to democratize knowledge and skills. Whether empowering people who can't code to build apps, or helping non-native English speakers communicate more clearly, AI exists to bridge gaps. Similarly, art should never be exclusively reserved for those who possess enough talent, resources, or time. Creativity is inherently universal, and everyone deserves the opportunity to express it.

I personally love art, yet lack the time and training to become skilled at drawing. Like many others juggling numerous responsibilities, AI-generated art provides me an opportunity to engage creatively in ways previously impossible. It opens doors, brings joy, and adds value to our already complex lives.

Additionally, there's a significant legal context often overlooked in these discussions. Japan explicitly permits AI models to be trained on copyrighted material. Even if OpenAI or similar platforms integrate elements inspired by studios like Ghibli, they are operating fully within the bounds of the law. Rather than inciting outrage, this should encourage us to thoughtfully explore questions about creativity, inspiration, and evolving norms.

Historically, the art world has regularly resisted new technologies. When photography emerged in the 19th century, prominent painters fiercely opposed it, fearing it might replace traditional painting. Artists like Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres even formally objected to recognizing photography as a legitimate art form. Yet, photography not only endured but flourished as a respected medium.

The same resistance resurfaced in the late 20th century with the advent of digital art. Critics and artists argued digital art lacked authenticity or diminished the value of traditional methods. However, digital art gradually gained acceptance, proving that technology and creativity can coexist harmoniously, enriching artistic expression.

Instead of policing creativity, let's embrace technological advancements for the accessibility and inspiration they provide. History shows initial resistance often evolves into acceptance and innovation. Let's celebrate the new opportunities AI offers, allowing more people than ever to find joy and fulfillment through art.
